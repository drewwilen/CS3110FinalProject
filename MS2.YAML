Though currently only including the basic implementation for a user agreement and age-checking,
our brokerage platform will use a SQL Database management system to offer interactive
modeling technology for analyzing stocks as well as functionality for users to buy and
sell stocks, options, ETFs, and potentially more. The platform will allow users to 
easily manage and interact with their personal portfolios, and look at individual stocks,
allowing them to live-track stocks. As a stretch goal, 
we hope to implement work on algorithms to trade on.
