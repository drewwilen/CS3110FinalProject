Our stock brokerage platform offers users the ability to buy and sell 
stocks of their choosing, including real-time acquisition of stock prices to 
allow users to build up-to-date portfolios. Additionally, our platform 
allows users to backtest their portfolio based on historical data for which they
can customize the length of the period they backtest for. Additionally, our platform
allows users to create custom options contracts and price contracts using various algorithms
including Black-Scholes and binomial pricing, as well as allowing for users to 
calculate prices of option Greeks, including theta and delta.
